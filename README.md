The Starlight terrace at the Oasis is modestly busy. It's Saturday night which means the music could be rock, soul funk, tribute or a mix. Tonight it's rock.

It's a varied demagraphic, mostly middle aged married couples getting their groove on with a mix of younger folk watching and enjoying the sunset.

And then he appears.

Early 30's, jean jacket, glasses, long hair, and a red bandana. He calibrates with the band, offering up some appreciative fist pumps to the middle-aged rockers. Later, he approaches the stage and holds up his Bic lighter high in appreciation.

I'm not sure what the band thinks of all this singular devotion. I'm guessing a flock of tipsy soccer mom's would be more their speed, but the point is, this guy has found his tribe and feels he belongs. And isn't that the bottom line?

## Big Data and the Search for Home

In a world of options, can big-data help us find the place where we'll feel most at home?

[City Rank](https://github.com/zenglenn42/CityRank/blob/master/README.md), a 2-week software bootcamp project, explored that idea a bit. However there's only so much that can be done in such a short time.

City Match is an effort to improve the user experience of City Rank through additional front-end design and thoughtful implementation of desired features.

## Thumb Ninja

My focus shifts from stage to a nearby table where a woman whips out her phone and fluidly navigates through texts and images, powered by the sultry grace of her thumb. There's an ease and comfort here that seem very natural. I want City Match to be that easy to navigate. In the morning, I come up with this:

Three screens. A landing page, a preference page, and a results page, all thumb-navigable by a floating action button near the footer. The results page also features multiple views on the same data:

- list view
- image view
- chart view
- map view

On desktop, I could see offering more than one view at a time. But right now, I'm thinking about mobile mostly. That's the plan.
